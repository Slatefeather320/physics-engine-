# physics-engine-
I made a simple physics engine to simulate a ball bouncing using python and pygame. 

controls - 
arrow keys to move the ball 
g - toggles gravity 
f - toggles friction and energy loss 
x - removes all viocity the ball has
r - starts recording a path behind the ball 
c - clears path
